# UANdINO
Calculates the transition/survival probabilities of a(n) (anti)neutrino that travels through a certain density profile.

This program is based on the calculations done by Ohlsson and Snellman in

1. *Ohlsson, T., & Snellman, H. (2001). Neutrino oscillations with three flavors in matter of varying density. The European Physical Journal C, 20(3), 507–515. https://doi.org/10.1007/s100520100687*.

It also relies on GSL library.

## Version

+ uandino_v01: Reproduces figures 1-5 from reference 1.
+ uandino_v02: Is supposed to involve changes in the implementation of the density functions related with numerical problems.
